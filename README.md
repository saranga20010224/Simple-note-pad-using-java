# Simple Notepad 

This notepad app built using Java Swing supporting file operations, editing tools, an About dialog, and text color selection.

We can run the app as below.

   - Open the `SimpleNotepad.java` file in IDE.
   - Compile and run:
     ```
     javac SimpleNotepad.java
     java SimpleNotepad
     ```

This app saves and loads text files only, so no database is required.

## Assumptions

- Files are saved as plain `.txt`.
- Color picker changes the text color in the main editing area.
- Project only uses local file operations, no authentication.
- Works on any OS supporting Java Swing.
